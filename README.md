Hey, this is a little and funny rickroll.exe made buy THE_SPECTRE-FR (alisas rommeldufutur) !

Here you can find,
  -The source code
  -A compiled setup
  
How does it work ?
I know, this source code is a little bit a mess xD but, i'll explain you how it works ;)

You have a "ico" directory, in this directory there is the icone for: the setup and the rickroll.exe (i did not add the ico file into the rickroll.exe... i'm sorry but if you want, you can add it with ressource hacker software on windows, i do not code on Linux .... btw, I LOVE DEBIAN !!! ;))))  )
There is a "Music" directory, it's explicit xD
"Output" folder is used for the compiling process (mingw32-make, with the MakeFile in "src" folder..)
"Picture", explicit too x)
"READY" folder contains the Setup and the "Ready-to-fire" rickroll x)
"Requires", here there are all DLLs needed, the background image, and the music
AND, finally, the "src" folder, here there is the code ;)
